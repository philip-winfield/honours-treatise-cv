Welcome to the repository showcasing my BSc Honours treatise â€“ "Optimisation of Humanoid Robot Walking Gaits"

My main project during my honours year involved optimising a humanoid robot's performance using genetic algorithms. This endeavour required a multidisciplinary approach, as I utilised Java and LUA scripts for simulation and C++ for embedding the trained controller onto the physical robot. This experience not only honed my programming abilities but also showcased my ability to tackle complex problems using innovative solutions.
